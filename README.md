# Security Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any part of our code, please do not post it publicly using our wikis or issue trackers; instead, please read our [security page](https://meta.nepalpedia.org/wiki/Security) carefully and follow the instructions.

As a quick overview, you can email security concerns to security@nepalpedia.org, emergency@nepalpedia.org or, if you prefer, you can directly create a security-related task [here](https://issue-tracker.nepalmedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/forms), but please leave the "Security" project on the issue.
